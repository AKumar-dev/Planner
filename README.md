# Planner

An agenda/planner web application designed to increase productivity by offering a straightforward approach to daily planning: a date and an event.

### Vision: 
The plan was to create an application that would replace my use of notepad (which I currently use as a planner because it is easily accessable), and also add HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript to my toolkit.
Users can add categories for different things they want to plan for, such as courses, hobbies, events, personal things they want to track, etc. Withing those categories, there is a feature that automatically adds a line when the a user presses enter, ready to take in the next line of input. Previous entries can be updated by pressing the down arrow key (similar to ctrl+s in Word) and tilda/backquote to delete an entry. To delete a complete category, go to the first entry of the category and press the up arrow key.

### Challenges: 
This was my first time using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so it was mainly an exercise in getting familiar with the languages. I also had limited experience with Firebase (and none with Firebase and JavaScript), so it was an opportunity to gain some knowledge in that direction. I was also on a time crunch, which meant that I was not able to add all the functionality I wanted.

### Implementation/End product: 
HTML and CSS were used for the basic layout, and JavaScript was used for linking with Google Firebase Realtime Database, and also for adding functionality to input text fields, creating categories, and deleting/updating entries.

## Overall: 
While the app was not functioning as properly (in terms of reading from the database) as I would have liked, it was a great window into the world of JavaScript, hopefully paving the way for Angular once I become comfortable with JavaScript.
